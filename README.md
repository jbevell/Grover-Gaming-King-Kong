<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>From 2017 to 2024, I worked for a charitable gaming company called Grover Gaming. One of my biggest projects there was working as a Game Developer on the King Kong-themed board for their Fusion 4 collection. This was one of their more ambitious projects at the time and has a series of features that can be combined to play out in various orders.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
The features include:
<ul>
	<li>Wild Reels</li>
    <ul>
    	<li>Kong has a chance to knock a plane from the air, making one reel match any of its neighboring reels' symbols. He can also sometimes miss the plane.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Kong Nudge</li>
    <ul>
    	<li>Kong may slam down on a losing board, nudging the symbols into a position to create a winning board.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Kong Roar</li>
    <ul>
    	<li>On some losing boards, Kong can let out a mighty roar, shattering some of the symbols and creating a higher value, winning board. There are two versions of this and one removes all but the highest paying symbols. It can also drop a Bonus feature.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Kong Spins</li>
    <ul>
    	<li>The sky grows dark and a storm rolls in. Kong will begin swiping symbols away from the pay table until a winning board is presented.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Bonus</li>
    <ul>
    	<li>An ominous red glow sets over what will be a climactic assault on King Kong. Planes will fly at the giant ape, peppering him with machine gun fire as he tries to swipe them from the air. Each plane destroyed adds to your total payout with a chance for a large zeppelin to add even more. This Bonus has the option that, once the assault has played out, you may retry the Bonus up to two more times for the chance of a higher payout.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
